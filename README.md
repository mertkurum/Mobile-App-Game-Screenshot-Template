# Mobile App Game Screenshot Template for Photoshop

[Download Link](soon)

Modify your screenshots and make ready to be uploaded to AppStore or Google Play in 5 mins. As a game programmer, creating screenshots for stores were a nightmare to me. 

There are also some other templates on the internet but They are not useful for me anymore. However, they helped me to create this one so I want to link them here also.
